# Alzhaimer classification using Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI)
Project to classify Alzhaimer's disease through brain MRI using CNN and U-Net to improve image quality.

## Libraries used:
- Tensorflow.
- Pandas.
- Numpy.
- Matplotlib.
- Scikit-learn.
## Dataset:
The Dataset has images of brain magnetic resonance collected by Washington University of Medicine in St. Louis with the name of OASIS as an open access dataset for research from the scientific community, the whole dataset has 80,000 2D images from 461 patients with slices from the MRI within 100-160 range, this images reflect four classes: demented (488) , very mild demented (13,725) , mild demented (5,002) and non-demented (67,222) also showing all the progression of the disease.
